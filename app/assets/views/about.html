<h3>Constructs and line generation</h3><br>
<p>All enhancer trap lines were generated by Tol2-mediated transgenesis (Kawakami et al., 2000). The enhancer trap lines express the Gal4 variant KalTA4 (Distel et al., 2009) to allow flexible transgene expression in the neurons of interest.</p>

<p class="right">The library was created using constructs (Figure 1) with two different minimal promotors, hsp as well as cFos. To restrict expression to neurons and reduce expression in non-neuronal tissues human NRSE elements (Namikawa et al., 2006) were inserted into both promotors. The constructs were furthermore flanked by attp sites to allow for cassette exchange of the entire expression cassette (Hu et al., 2001).</p>
<p>Larval zebrafish six days post fertilization expressing UAS-Kaede (Scott et al., 2007) were imaged and resulting stacks were registered to the Z-Brain (Randlett et al., 2015) for easy comparison of expression patterns.</p>
<p>Registered high resolution stacks can be downloaded from the website and individual fish lines can be ordered from the Engert lab.</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Funding for the generation of the enhancer trap line resource was
provided by the NIH with grant <em>R24NS086601</em> to Florian Engert.</p>
